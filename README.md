This project is analyzing the change in overwintering monarch populations in California 1997-2023, and Mexico from 2006-2022. 
The California overwintering monarch population dataset was obtained from Xerces Society Western Monarch Count (2024).
Mexico overwintering monarch population dataset was obtained from the US Geological Survey. 
Climate data for California and Mexico was obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and World Bank Group, Climate Change Knowledge Portal, respectively. 
All statistical tests and visualizations were run and created using R studio version 2024.04.0 + 735, and the following packages "ggplot2", "tidyverse", "shiny", and "car".![image](https://github.com/myerseg/BIO611_FinalProject/assets/167452475/eaf44ccb-2125-4a00-86ff-bba77b28c5ce)
